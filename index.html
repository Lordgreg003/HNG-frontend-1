              <p>Hi dear</p>
              <p class="x">My name is Nwokoye Chidera</p>
              <p>I develop efficient and scalable web solutions</p>
              <p>
                I tell computers "DO THIS!!", and they refuse. Then I cry for a
                very long time ðŸ˜­
              </p>
              <p>
                My name is Nwokoye Chidera, a front-end web developer from
                Nigeria. I am on the journey to become a full-stack web
                developer/Mobile developer. I love to build fun and scalable
                stuff on the web which requires paying attention to detail and
                being ready to learn new things when required.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over time, I have acquired a solution-oriented personality used
                to deliver efficient, accessible and creative
                solutions/experiences to one and all.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not programming, I love being in very quiet spaces.
                Watching Anime. Talking about how awesome Ribena is. Surfing the
                internet for fast cars. Or Playing video games.

                To become a well-rounded developer, I will expand my knowledge
                to include back-end development. This involves learning
                server-side languages and frameworks such as Node.js, Express,
                Python, and Django. I also plan to gain experience with
                databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Understanding
                back-end development will enable me to build robust and scalable
                applications that handle data efficiently.

                With the increasing use of mobile devices, developing mobile
                applications has become crucial. I aim to learn mobile
                development frameworks such as React Native and Flutter to
                create cross-platform applications for both iOS and Android. By
                diving into mobile app development, I will be able to reach a
                broader audience and provide seamless experiences across
                different devices.
